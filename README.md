Modal Window Demo Project üñºÔ∏è

This is a simple project demonstrating how to create and implement a modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Modal windows are commonly used for pop-ups, forms, or displaying important information to users without navigating away from the current page.

    Keyboard Accessibility: Close the modal by pressing the "Escape" key.
    Responsive Design: Works on different screen sizes and devices.

üéÆ How to Use

    Open Modal: Click the "Open Modal" button to display the modal window.
    Close Modal:
        Click the "Close" button inside the modal, or
        Click outside the modal (on the overlay), or
        Press the "Escape" key on your keyboard.

The modal will close, returning you to the original page view.
